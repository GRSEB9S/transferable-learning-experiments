## Downloading data

Create a file called settings.config with an flickr API Key and Secret.

```{
 "KEY": "skladfjlksfjlfskjsdfkjhsdfkjh",
 "SECRET": "aijskljsfjklsfdljk"
}```

Then run `python fetch_data.py`

## Training
`python alexnet.py`

## TODOs
* Partition training and test data
* Lesioning
* Transferring weights / adding interface for this
